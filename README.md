# NLP with Python
This repository is a collection of Natural Language Processing with Python course code I have attended the online course https://www.udemy.com/course/nlp-natural-language-processing-with-python/ on Udemy. <br/>
In this course we learn to use Machine Learning, Spacy, NLTK, SciKit-Learn, Deep Learning, and more to conduct Natural Language Processing.
